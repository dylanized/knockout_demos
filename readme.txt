Here is a collection of demos for Knockout.js, the Javascript data binding library.

I made these demos for a presentation at @STLJS, the St. Louis Javascript Meetup, but wanted to share them because Knockout's official demos can be a little confusing. I hope you find them useful.

Demos 1-3 show Knockout's basic functionality, using observables, dependent observables, and binding events to elements.

Demos 4-6 show the use of jQuery templates, including observable arrays and nested templates. These demos require the jQuery template library to be loaded.

TODOS:

* Demo featuring the new internal Knockout templates
* Demo featuring the Mapping plugin
* Demo featuring Ajax live updating

Other ideas welcome!

Note: these have not been tested in IE
