Here is a collection of demos for Knockout.js, the Javascript data binding library.

I made these demos for a presentation at STLJS, the St. Louis Javascript Meetup, but wanted to share them because Knockout's official demos can be a little confusing. I hope you find them useful.

Demos 1-3 show Knockout's basic functionality, using observables, dependent observables, and binding events to elements.

Demos 4-6 show the use of jQuery templates, including observable arrays and nested templates. These demos require the jQuery template script to be loaded.

Demo #7 shows the use of the Mapping plugin, which allows raw JSON data to be mapped to Knockout's viewmodel.

If you have any questions, hit me up!
